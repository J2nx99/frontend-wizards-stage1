        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m <strong>Joshua Omilani</strong>, a dedicated
          <strong>frontend developer</strong> and
          <strong>Mechanical Engineering student</strong> passionate about
          creating user-friendly, responsive web applications. My main stack
          includes <strong>React, Next.js, JavaScript, and Node.js</strong>, and
          I’m constantly refining my skills to build efficient, scalable, and
          accessible solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience developing clean, modern interfaces and
          collaborating on team projects where attention to detail, version
          control, and code quality matter. I enjoy solving front-end challenges
          that combine logic and design, and I’m motivated by opportunities to
          learn from experienced engineers and contribute to meaningful
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to grow into a well-rounded engineer capable of translating
          ideas into seamless digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
